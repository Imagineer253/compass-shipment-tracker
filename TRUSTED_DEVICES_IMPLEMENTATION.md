## üîÑ **User Flow**

### **First-Time Login with 2FA:**
1. User enters email/password
2. System detects 2FA is enabled
3. System checks if device is trusted ‚Üí **Not found**
4. User redirected to 2FA verification page
5. User enters 2FA code
6. **User checks "Remember this device for 30 days"**
7. System creates trusted device record
8. User logged in successfully

### **Subsequent Login on Trusted Device:**
1. User enters email/password
2. System detects 2FA is enabled
3. System checks if device is trusted ‚Üí **Found & Valid**
4. **2FA automatically bypassed**
5. User logged in directly with "Welcome back! Logged in from trusted device." message

### **Device Management:**
1. User navigates to Profile ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Devices
2. Views list of all trusted devices with details
3. Can revoke individual devices or all devices
4. Expired devices automatically cleaned up

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Implementation**

### **Device Identification:**
```python
def generate_device_fingerprint(user_agent, ip_address):
    fingerprint_data = f"{user_agent}:{ip_address}:{secrets.token_hex(8)}"
    return hashlib.sha256(fingerprint_data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### **Trust Verification:**
- Checks device fingerprint match
- Verifies device is active and not expired
- Updates last_used_at timestamp
- Returns boolean result for trust status

### **Automatic Cleanup:**
- Removes expired devices on each access
- Maintains database efficiency
